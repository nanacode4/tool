        Python Introduction
      </Typography>
      <Typography>
        Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simple syntax and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and
        first released in 1991. Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including
        structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due
        to its comprehensive standard library.

        Comments
      </Typography>
      <Typography>
        Python has commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation. Comments can be used to explain Python code. Comments can be used
        to make the code more readable. Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.
      </Typography>
      <Typography>Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them:</Typography>
      <CodeBlock>
        {`# This is a comment 
print("Hello, World!")`}
      </CodeBlock>
      <PaginationNav />
